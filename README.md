# Recommender System
## Unsupervised Learning Project

Two Solutions:
* Solution A: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation model
* Solution B: Neural Collaborative Filtering - https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031

In this notebook, we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item. 

 Solution  A: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation model
This recommendation is however based on Collaborative filtering which uses easily captured user behaviour data. The rating data is represented using a matrix where users are along the rows and products are along the columns.


## Collaborative Filtering
* User-Item Filtering
* Item-Item Filtering
